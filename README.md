# Tables
Safe keeping of a table display, wich sorts by column, displays a chosen number of entries and can browse through pages.

Faire attention Ã  la version de CSS et JavaScript
In this example we use an old version of CSS, JavaScript and Jquery, as I had to integrate this table into a website that wasn't up to date.
A problem occures when it wants to sort by dates. I will work on it during my trainship with Ediref. If I find a solution I'll try to think to update this file.
